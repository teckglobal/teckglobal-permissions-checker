A WordPress plugin by Teck Global to check and fix file and folder permissions in the WordPress root directory.

== Description ==
Teck Global Permissions Checker scans all files and folders in the WordPress root directory and reports on their permissions. It highlights misconfigured permissions in a color-coded table:
- **Green:** Permissions are correct (644 for files, 755 for directories).
- **Yellow:** Permissions differ from recommended but are not critical.
- **Red:** Permissions are too permissive (e.g., 777 for directories, 666 for files), posing a security risk.

### Features
- Scans the entire WordPress root directory recursively.
- Reports current permissions, recommended permissions, and status for each file and folder.
- Color-coded table for easy identification of issues.
- "Fix" button to repair individual file/folder permissions.
- "Fix All" button to correct all permissions at once, with a warning during the process.
- Built-in sorting for the permissions report table.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What are the recommended permissions? =
Files should be 644 (readable by all, writable by owner), and directories should be 755 (readable/executable by all, writable by owner).

= Why are some permissions marked as critical? =
Permissions like 777 or 666 allow anyone to write to the file or directory, which is a security risk on a web server.

= Why might fixing permissions fail? =
The web server user (e.g., `www-data`) must have permission to modify files. If files are owned by another user (e.g., `root`), fixes may fail, requiring manual adjustment via SSH.

== Screenshots ==
1. Permissions report table with "Fix" and "Fix All" options, showing color-coded statuses.
